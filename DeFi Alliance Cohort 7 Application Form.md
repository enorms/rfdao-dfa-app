## What are you building?*
### Maximum 50 characters, e.g. “Lending & borrowing on Ethereum”.

Product hunt with tokens.


## Expand on what you're building.*
### Share more details on how your product works or will work. Maximum 3 paragraphs.

The best startups are not chosen by popularity, since many good new ideas seem stupid at first (or they would have been implemented already). Up votes, surveys and polls do not map directly to actual behavior.

So we are building a platform where customers and/or investors can request products or features to be built under certain requirements, and founders can agree to build them. We will implement a utility token and require spending or staking to make requests or changes, and require committing currency tokens in advance (i.e. 1 eth if x,y, and z; cost 1 RequestForToken to submit). This should be a parallel vector to actual market needs and give a head start to the builder and something of use to the requester.

Lastly, we will serve as the oracle for the smart contracts to know if conditions have been met; this is a natural avenue for community involvement and reputation building through token rewards/slashing, etc.


## Where is most of your team located? *
### We use this to pair companies with local mentors and schedule check-ins.

USA/Canada


## Name, Title, email, etc

Eric Norman, Founder, [enx@rfdao.xyz], ...


## Summarize your academic and professional background.*
### Where did you study, when, what companies have you worked for or started before, titles. Maximum 2 paragraphs.

OrangeDAO pre-charter member. SVP Pioneer Fund. Angel investor. Founded and served as CEO of hardware startup that shipped product and was acquired. Recently studied CS and math at CCSF, masters at UCSD, BA at UPenn.


## What personal academic or professional achievement are you most proud of?*

I was quite pleased to go from no understanding of computer science to being a TA for C++ including the core Data Structures and a tutor for the department, specifically to be asked back, and for students to seek me out again. You see how much you have learned, you can feel the impact. (In a couple years)


## How many founders does the company have?*
### For each founder, please provide further detail as you did above.

- Eric (above)
- Luke Iseman was YC's first first Director of Hardware and took two startups he founded through the program.
- stealth founder currently working on existing startup


## When and how did the founders meet? Have you worked on other projects together in the past?
### Skip this question if you're a solo founder.

Eric met Luke in 2015 when going through YC while Luke was director of hardware. They discuss crypto and projects, and are colleagues as Pioneer Fund SVPs. They met Ryan in OrangeDAO and were all excited by the ability to use crypto to fundamentally change how new products and features, perhaps fundraising itself, is done.


## What ecosystem are you building on?
### If you're building on multiple ecosystems please select where's your focus right now.
Eth
Sol
Polygon


## When did you start working on this idea? Are you committed to it full time and, if so, since when?*

December '21, Eric is full time from January '22, Luke and founder 3 are ready to LFG when needed or upon acceptance.


## Do you have users or any initial sign of engagement?*
### Share details on your product's usage and growth.

Yes we have (an early alpha) item with a funding and usage commitment, in the process of obtaining such commitments for other existing requests (generated by OrangeDAO members, many for things they urgently need / want to buy).


## Why are you working on this idea? How do you know it's an important problem to solve? Do you have any previous experience in the area?*

We are at a key moment in time with crypto where much needs to be built, similar to the late 90s when various web structure was built and companies like Amazon founded. Building and operating in actual DAOs we see and hear first hand which specific products are needed. We have all been involved in creating new products, launching new features, and fundraising; these are key activities which are still performed with great intuition and experimentation. It's almost the fundamental activity of capitalism, allocating the capital to the best resources (for society).


## What other projects are solving this problem today or could if they wanted to? Why will your project succeed against them?*

More traditional incubators exist like Long Hash, new experiments with various investment DAOs or even creating companies via HyperScale. If they also offered paying customers and committed funding upon milestones with smart contracts they could be competitors. We find there is a mismatch with community investing and choosing good startups, Eric observed this as an early HyperScale member when it was decided to use community voting (popularity) for selection. Having been founders and lived among founders and invested in founders, we know that one strong signal is actually a better indicator. So we are building for that; putting your money where your mouth is is + your reputation on the line is about as strong as it gets.


## What's your distribution strategy?*
### How do you plan to get users for your product?

We will start inside OrangeDAO for which requests already exist and founders looking for projects or new companies abound; since this community is made up of founders we expect the requests, responses, and accountability to be strong. As the idea is proven out, we will open it to any founder who wants to approach an idea. That draws in more ideas, and then network effects should help. We will also ask successes to note they were jumpstarted by Request For which provides viral marketing to all product users.


## Have you incorporated or set any legal structure? If so, where? Please share any relevant details.

TBD


## What is the equity breakdown between each founder?*
## If equity is not equally divided, clarify why.

1/n but plan to build token first



## Have you received any investments so far? If so, from which investors and at what valuations?*

[]


## Why are you applying to the DeFi Alliance?*
### Are there specific areas you're looking for help with?

We know the value of a strong cohort of companies and experienced advisors as each of us has gone through YC, and we have heard from graduates and other sources that DFA is strong for crypto startups.



## Did anyone recommend you to apply? If so, who?*
### You may ask referrals to existing DA network members after submitting the application. Simply ask them to email referrals@defialliance.co with your company name and reasons for the recommendation.
